# Cragapple
_an app for streamers to gantt-triage repeated new-audience questions that repeat incessantly but can be batch-answered by human host or og_

##



## Development Intro
There is no custom server side python in this application.  Cragapple uses some python-shell scripts to set up before the production-level database is introduced (probably a django situation after prototyping stage)

### Goal
[] We need a good database.  

While everything is here to present stuff correctly to the user -- it's barely passes as working


## Setup

1. implement on your computer (mac) and coding environment*


```
# enable executable permissions to run the file
$ chmod +x ./make-venv
```

...and then

```
# Makes a virtual environment specifically for this app
$ ./make-venv
```

Python's virtual env (is called `venv`) will also download what you need for this app per this repo's code.

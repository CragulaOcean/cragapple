# Cragapple
_an app for streamers to gantt-triage repeated new-audience questions that repeat incessantly but can be batch-answered by human host or og_

##



## Development Intro
There is no custom server side python in this application.  Cragapple uses [entrance](https://github.com/ensoft/entrance) before probably moving to a django situation after prototyping stage

### Goal
- implement actual database as a learning exercise
- assess whether app aligns to having closed captioning on board


## Setup

_steps to implement on your computer (mac) and coding environment_

1. clone the repo

```
# enable executable permissions to run the file
$ chmod +x ./make-venv
```


```
# Makes a virtual environment specifically for this app
$ ./make-venv
```

Python's virtual env (is called `venv`) will also download what you need for this app per this repo's code.

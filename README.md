# Cragapple
_from streamers to brand-ambassadors,  repeat audience questions about what promo or referral codes support that creator might stay hidden and even feel a bit dry as they lack personalization at the start_

Cragapple Uses a space-inspired zoo NFT badge assignment scheme.


## Prototyping Phase
 You might see (compiled) snippets thrown about a la random. I need some of these parts to make it to IRL portfolio projects.  Some of the design might seem disjointed at first.  Expect to see design artifacts show up non-linearly with the offset that it binds the vibe in stages.
 
    ^Expect to see wonky references to css and seemingly random research
 
### Expect to see

- wonky css
- references to components with naming outside the theme of this project, until updated
- seemingly random research

### About git

- ```git commit```:commits will either be joke-punchline pairs, or vague blanket descriptors.
- ```git tag```: will contain references to the project direction with regard to UX or project direction



## Development Intro
There is no custom server side python in this application.  Cragapple uses [entrance](https://github.com/ensoft/entrance) before probably moving to a django situation after prototyping stage



### Goal
- implement actual database as a learning exercise
- assess whether app aligns to having closed captioning on board


## Setup

_steps to implement on your computer (mac) and coding environment_

1. clone the repo

```
# enable executable permissions to run the file
$ chmod +x ./make-venv
```


```
# Makes a virtual environment specifically for this app
$ ./make-venv
```

Python's virtual env (is called `venv`) will also download what you need for this app per this repo's code.

Automagically the code in this repo goes like this...


### Repo Code after the above

Automagically the code in this repo goes like this...

1. [elm:] Build a Production set to build at /static
1. [srv:] Look for index.html at /static dir, copied contents in order to serve with python



_...all that aside_
